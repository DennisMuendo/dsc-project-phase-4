    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "The United States has a long and intricate history of energy production marked by technological advancements, environmental concerns, and a growing demand for reliable and sustainable energy sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy production dates back to 1882 when Thomas Edison constructed Pearl Street Station, the first purpose –built power station. In the same year Edison’s power station, the world’s first hydroelectric plant, went on-line in Appleton, Wisconsin demonstrating the potential of hydropower as a renewable energy source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nation's energy landscape has since evolved from its early reliance on hydropower and fossil fuels to embrace a diversified mix of renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and geothermal power. This transition has been driven by environmental concerns, technological advancements, and government policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting energy independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the US energy mix is undergoing a significant transformation, with a growing share of renewable energy and natural gas, while coal's dominance is declining. This shift reflects the nation's commitment to decarbonization and the pursuit of cleaner energy sources. However, the challenge of producing enough energy to meet the demands of an ever-growing population remains"

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The United States is the world's second-largest producer of energy, producing about 16% of the world's energy, for both consumption and exportation. Energy production, however, is not a static process; it is subject to fluctuations that can have significant economic and social consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022 the United States was the largest consumer of energy consuming 100.41 quads according to U.S. Energy Information Administration. This means that ensuring a consistent and reliable energy supply is paramount for sustaining the nation's economic stability and meeting the needs of its population.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the U.S. transitions towards renewable energy sources, the phasing out of traditional energy sources might create a potential gap incapable of meeting the nation's energy demands. Ensuring a smooth transition necessitates a prediction model that accurately anticipates energy production, guaranteeing a balance between the declining traditional sources and the burgeoning renewable ones. Such a model becomes vital to prevent disruptions in energy supply, uphold stability, and sustainably meet the increasing energy needs during this pivotal shift in the energy landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Justification of the Study\n",
    "This study focuses on creating a dependable forecasting model for energy production. Accurate predictions empower efficient management of energy demand, aid in proper resource allocation and planning in line with production trends, and reduce costs associated with energy fluctuations. By developing a robust forecasting tool, this study aims to ensure consistent production, bolstering energy security, and enabling informed decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Objectives\n",
    "The main objectives in this project will be:\n",
    "1.\tDevelop a robust time series forecasting model that accurately predicts energy production patterns.\n",
    "2.\tIntegrate external variables such as weather data to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.\n",
    "3.\tCreate an adaptive model that can adjust to changing conditions and evolving production patterns.\n",
    "4.\tProvide a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to access and interpret forecasted energy production data.\n",
    "5.\tContribute to cost savings, efficient resource utilization, and environmental sustainability through improved energy production forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Metric of Success\n",
    "Building a model with a low MSE"
